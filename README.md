FusionTable-Map-MobileTemplate
==============================

Searchable Map Web App Template using Google Maps and Fusion Tables

Testing:
--------

The gh-pages branch is used to host this template example. You can access it
here:
http://sfbrigade.github.io/FusionTable-Map-MobileTemplate/
or via the bit.ly link: http://bit.ly/fusion-mobile

Todo:
-----
* Have a 'sample_data' directory containing.. 
    * the fusion table .csv
    * a template to generate the sample_data/business/ID.html pages
    * a python file to run over the csv and regen the ID.html pages
    * A comment on where the data came from!

* Why is it so slow to load? why does the map redraw break?

* Drop a "you are here - blue dot when you geolocate."

* Finish the about page

* Write rock-solid docs so that others can clone this and host their own
fusion tables. Re-arrange the javascript so the 'custom' code goes in one
place.
